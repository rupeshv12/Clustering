Data science clustering concepts

K-means clustering is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for partitioning a dataset into K distinct, non-overlapping subsets (clusters). The goal is to group similar data points together and assign them to clusters based on certain features. The algorithm works iteratively to assign each data point to one of K clusters, minimizing the within-cluster sum of squares.
